# KrateLabs

Krate Labs **designs and fabricates** illuminated laser etched displays. The innovative design allows only light to pass through the etched artwork, creating a unique and contemporary design. The contrasting colours from the background, the etching and the high grade plexiglass allow the map to stand out as a very distinct art piece for your home or business.

The lasering process allows us to etch the most intricate details with extreme precision, creating a very unique and detailed image of any location in the entire world.

Our contemporary designs highlights the cartography as the focal point as we fuse and blend the natural and urban landscapes into a design that we highlight with light itself. This allows the piece to stand out and light a room with a natural glow that can create an ambience or compliment an existing decor.
